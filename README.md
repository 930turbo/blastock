# Blastock ðŸš€

Welcome to Blastock, the easiest way to view stock data in just two simple steps.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of Blastock up and running on your machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
1. matplotlib
2. pandas
3. mpl_finance
4. pandas_datareader
```

## Project Goal

For this project, I wanted to create a program that (in a concise manner) would display stock information based on user input. As a data science student and programmer at heart, I honestly didn't know too much about the stock market or extracting data from it. I was able to shorten this version (public release 1.0) to only 57 lines of code. This allows this version to be the opposite of resource intensive and it's able to display all the required data in a neat fashion. 

### Reading the Chart

The first chart is comparing volume of stock sales to year and also keeping count of highs and lows as far as sale price. The second chart is an average calculated.

## Versioning

Public Beta 1.0
