## Project Goal

For this project, I wanted to create a program that would display stock information based on user input. As a data science student this project seemed like a fun challenge and would also allow me to start on the creation of my personal thesis paper. I was able to shorten this version (public release 1.0) to only 57 lines of code allowing for this vpublic version to be lightweight.

### Reading the Chart

The first chart is comparing volume of stock sales to year and also keeping count of highs and lows as far as sale price. The second chart is an average calculated.

## Versioning

Public Beta 1.0
